Welcome to our very rough docs and thanks for bearing with us as we get them into our main documentation!

I recommend starting at 'welcome' or 'quickstart' to learn how to get set up with an agent. Beyond that, our guide for adding agent capabilities is helpful for learning how to get new features into AgentKit.

If you're wanting to learn more about how agentkit works, check out the architecture guide and wallet provider sections.
