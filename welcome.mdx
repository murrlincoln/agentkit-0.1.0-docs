AgentKit is a toolkit that gives AI agents to access crypto wallets and onchain functionality. Powered by the CDP SDK, it allows agents to autonomously perform any onchain interaction, including transfers, swaps, token deployments, and arbitrary contract invocations. Our [agent quickstart](/agentkit/docs/quickstart) can get an agent running using AgentKit in less than 5 minutes.


## Overview

AgentKit provides:
- Model-agnostic design that works with several LLM APIs, including OpenAI, Claude, and Llama
- Plugs into any AI agent framework
- Native integration with the CDP SDK for onchain capabilities, including smart contract deployments, trades, transfers, contract reads and writes,and price feeds.
- Template structure for adding custom functionality
- Support for [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) and any existing Langchain tools
