Building with AgentKit this weekend? This guide covers the quickest way to get started with Coinbase Developer Platform using AI-assisted tools like Replit Agent and Cursor, which can help you build much faster. It also has project ideas and links to helpful resources.

### CDP Overview

Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) provides APIs and SDKs that let you **build anything onchain**:
- **[AgentKit](/agentkit/docs/welcome)**: Create and manage AI agents that can take actions onchain - trading, deploying smart contracts, reading and writing to smart contracts, posting on X/Twitter, deploying tokens and NFTs, and more.
- **[OnchainKit](https://onchainkit.xyz/getting-started)**: Front-end SDK with React components making it dead-simple to build magical front-end experiences for your onchain app. Don't miss the new [Checkout component](https://onchainkit.xyz/checkout/checkout) if your app will accept payments!
- **[CDP SDK](/cdp-sdk/docs/welcome)**: Powerful back-end SDK with APIs to create wallets, transfer, trade, deploy tokens and NFTs, and more.
- **[Coinbase Commerce](/commerce-onchain/docs/welcome)**: Enable merchants to accept crypto payments via API or UI.
- **[Staking](/staking/docs/welcome)**: Stake ETH and SOL with a simple API call.
- **[Onramp](/onramp/docs/welcome)**: Enable users to move money seamlessly between fiat and crypto economies.

## Getting Started
The best way to get up and running quickly is to check out our [quickstart](/agentkit/docs/quickstart), [templates](/agentkit/docs/resources-and-templates), and [community guides](/agentkit/docs/community-guides).

We recommend starting with one of our [Replit templates](https://replit.com/@CoinbaseDev) or creating your own using the Replit Agent, and using Cursor as your IDE by following the [connection instructions](https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/ssh#connecting-to-your-repl).
